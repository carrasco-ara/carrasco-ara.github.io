## Build a Portfolio Site 
*Araceli Carrasco*

Portfolio is a simple responsive page using Bootstrap v3 CSS Framework for Responsive Design.
Among all the available CSS frameworks out there, Bootstrap is my favorite.
Bootstrap is built on responsive 12-column grids, layouts and components and can be used for fixed grid or a responsive, its only matter of a few changes.
I like that it has base styling for most HTML elements and has extensive list of components, bundled Javascript plugins and good documentation.
